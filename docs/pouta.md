# cPouta Production Environment

Production environment is updated automatically everytime new code is pushed to the main branch.
Read more about the CI-CD [here](/docs/ci-cd.md).

## cPouta Cloud Service

cPouta is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud provided by [CSC](https://www.csc.fi/).

The cPouta virtual machines can be connected to external IP addresses, which then can be directly accessed on the internet. Floating IP allocated to our project is 128.214.253.51.

In order to access cPouta cloud, you need to accept terms in [My CSC Portal](https://my.csc.fi/projects/2004807). Make sure you are in the project 2004807 page. Then scroll down and click cPouta heading in the right column. Accept the terms.

You can then access the [cPouta Dashboard](https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/instances/).

## How to access cPouta instance with SSH

1. You need to have an access key named `pouta.key` in your `.ssh` folder. If you are missing the key, ask from a team member. 

2. Make sure that you are in the `.ssh` -folder and open the connection from your terminal with command:

```bash
ssh -i pouta.key ubuntu@128.214.253.51
```

## How to update Ubuntu in Pouta instance

Currently security and other updates to Ubuntu need to be run manually. Open the terminal application and open the SSH access.

```bash
# Fetch updates for the packages
$ sudo apt-get update

# Update the packages
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

# Reboot the Ubuntu box
$ sudo reboot
```

## Basic Docker commands to be used in Pouta

When you have a SSH connection open to Pouta, you can check which docker containers are running and which ports are allocated to them:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

If the app has stopped running, you can start it manually. These containers should be always running: 
*ubuntu-nginx-1*, *ubuntu-wbased-back-1*, *ubuntu-wbased-front-1* and *ubuntu-watchtower-1*.  

If the site is not responding, try restarting the containers using these two commands:

```bash
# Shut down all of the containers
$ sudo docker compose down

# Start all of the containers
$ sudo docker compose up -d
```
Here is a couple of more commands that can be useful in troubleshooting:

```bash
# Get a list of all of the containers
$ sudo docker container ls -a

# Remove unused containers
$ sudo docker container prune

# Remove all of the containers and images
$ sudo docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
$ sudo docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
```

## Removing old Docker images in Pouta

Everytime an update is made, a new image with a tag "latest" is created. This does not remove the old images, which keep piling up. Therefore, we have a cron job running docker prune every night at 3 a.m. UTC. 

```bash
0 3 * * * /snap/bin/docker system prune -a -f
```
You can edit the cron job with command in the root directory of our instance.

```bash
crontab -e
```
## Docker Containers

Currently we have 4 Docker containers up and running, these are:

**wbased-back**: This is the backend service built using the Docker image `ruusukivi/wbased-back:latest`. It has the `watchtower` label to enable automatic updates. The service is set to restart unless manually stopped and it's connected to the network `ubuntu_default`.

**wbased-front**: This is the frontend service built using the Docker image `ruusukivi/wbased-front:latest`. It also has the `watchtower` label for automatic updates. This service is exposed on port `3000` and it's set to restart unless manually stopped. It's also connected to the network `ubuntu_default`.

**nginx**: This is the reverse proxy server. It uses the `nginx` image and it's configured with a custom nginx configuration file. This service is exposed on port `80` and is also connected to the network `ubuntu_default`. It's set to restart unless manually stopped. The nginx reverse proxy is set to route all requests coming to `/api/` to the backend service. This means all client requests must go through the reverse proxy, which provides an additional layer of security.

**watchtower**: This service is used to automatically update the Docker containers. It uses the `containrrr/watchtower` image and it has access to the Docker socket, allowing it to monitor the other services. The command `--label-enable --interval 60` tells Watchtower to only update containers with the specific Watchtower label and to check for updates every 60 seconds.
